# Robust Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotor using Sliding Mode Control

## 1.1 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a robust control scheme using sliding mode control to enable a quadrotor to track
desired trajectories in the presence of external disturbances. The developed controller is tested on the crazyflie 2.0 quadcopter simulation in Gazebo.

## 1.2 Project Setup

## 1.3 Project Report and Additional Info
1. The dynamic model for the quadcopter can be found here. 
2. The project report documenting the dervations of trajectories, sliding mode control laws for the attitude and altitude control of the quadcopter can be found here.
